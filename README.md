# QDA-Net-Quantization-based-3D-CNN-through-Gradual-Unfreezing-for-DeepFake-detection

- The QDA_Net script implements the proposed QDA_Net model alongside the proposed Circural-Gradual-Unfreezing training strategy for deepfake detection.

- It also implements a 1-fold training and evaluation scheme based on our curated DFDC video dataset found in: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelpintelas/dfdc-facial-cropped-videos-dataset-jpg-frames/data
  followed by an analytical description.

- To run the framework:
  
        1) download our curated DFDC video dataset mentioned in the above link
  
        2) put it in the same folder with the QDA_Net script
  
        3) and then simply execute the QDA_Net script (the script has a suitable data loading function for this dataset format, making it simple the technical execution task)
